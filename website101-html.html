    <p>The guests peered into Classroom 316, where 3- and 4-year-olds from a Harlem children’s center had gathered around a table to decorate picture frames with stickers.</p>
    <p>“Do you know who’s coming to visit today?” an administrator asked the group.</p>
    <p>“Princess!” a girl named April shouted.</p>
    <p>And then, the Duchess of Cambridge sidled up beside her, in a diminutive seat labeled “chair,” and reached for the stickers.</p>
    <p>“Are these your friends?” the duchess asked the boy to her left, Sammy, who wore a Mickey Mouse shirt.</p>
  	<p>He began to name the entire class, before returning to the visitor. She smiled.</p>
  	<p>For about 90 minutes, she was the Duchess of East 110th Street.</p>
  	<p>With her husband, Prince William, spending much of the day in Washington — where he met President Obama and spoke at the World Bank — Catherine, the former Kate Middleton, spent the first leg of her first morning in New York at Northside Center for Child Development, wrapping gifts, nodding politely and discussing the merits of a recent cinematic princess with students.</p>
